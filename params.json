{"name":"Sirdemo","tagline":"A simple stereographic animation","body":"### What's here?\r\nThis is a demo program i put together in 2008 for a university exam on image generation and synthesis.\r\nIt uses OpenGL fragment shaders to generate a SIRD (Single-Image Random Dots) stereogram of a moving object on screen.\r\n[SPOILER: It's a teapot, what were you expecting?]\r\n\r\n### Features - What can it do?\r\nIt displays pretty images on screen.\r\nYou can't change the window size, you can't load 3-D models and sometimes you can't even close the window because the event handling code is very poor.\r\nAgain, it's a demo so it served its purpose and nothing more ;)\r\n\r\n### Why is it here?\r\nPretty much only to try the GitHub platform, since i don't plan to update the demo soon\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI (@AlexNava) did the program and the shaders, there are no other contributions at the moment.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
